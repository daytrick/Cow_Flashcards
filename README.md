# Name the Cow

This is an Android app that basically acts as digital flashcards for remembering the names of my stuff toy cows. 

It was made as practice before making larger Android apps, so I could get used to Kotlin and Android Studio.

Go to the [`release`](https://github.com/daytrick/Cow_Flashcards/tree/master/app/release) directory to find instructions on how to download and install.
